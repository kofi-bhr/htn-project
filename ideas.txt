random ideas for project umoja:

1. add social features?? like users can see other peoples profiles (anonymized)
2. maybe add a leaderboard for reputation tokens
3. gamification elements - badges for different achievements
4. integration with other defi protocols
5. mobile app version?? prob not for hackathon tho

technical stuff:
- need to optimize the world map component, its laggy on mobile
- add more animations to make it feel more polished
- the typewriter effect is cool but maybe too slow?
- consider adding sound effects?? idk might be too much

marketing ideas:
- create some demo videos
- write blog posts about the math behind efis
- maybe reach out to some fintech influencers??

also need to remember:
- test everything on different browsers
- make sure it works on slow connections
- accessibility stuff (screen readers, etc)
