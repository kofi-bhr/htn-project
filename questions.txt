questions for the team:

1. should we add more validation to the onboarding flow? like checking if the selfie is actually a face?

2. what happens if someone tries to mint multiple nfts? should we prevent that?

3. the efis scoring system - do we need to explain the math better to users? most people wont understand kalman filtering lol

4. mobile responsiveness - some components look weird on small screens, should we prioritize this?

5. error handling - what should we show users when wolfram api is down?

6. deployment - should we use vercel or try something else? vercel seems easiest

7. demo data - should we create some fake profiles for the demo?

8. accessibility - are we doing enough for screen readers and keyboard navigation?

9. performance - the world map animation might be too heavy for some devices

10. testing - how much testing should we do? unit tests vs manual testing?

also wondering:
- should we add a dark mode toggle?
- maybe add some tooltips to explain technical terms?
- the loading states could be more interesting than just spinners
