debug session 3/15/25

wallet connection issues:
- phantom wallet adapter not persisting connection on page refresh
- need to check if wallet is still connected in useEffect
- error: "wallet not found" when trying to mint nft

supabase stuff:
- profiles table working fine
- nft metadata storage is good
- need to add more fields to profiles table maybe??

wolfram api:
- working perfectly! 
- calculator page calculations are accurate
- need to add more error handling for api limits

next steps:
1. fix wallet persistence (priority 1)
2. improve error messages for users
3. add loading states everywhere
4. test on mobile devices
