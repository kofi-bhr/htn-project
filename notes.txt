ok soooo the landing page is basically done but i need to fix the wallet connection stuff
phantom wallet keeps disconnecting randomly and its rly annoying
also the nft minting is working but the metadata is kinda basic rn

todo:
- fix wallet persistence 
- add better error handling for failed transactions
- maybe add some loading states?? idk
- the calculator page needs work too but thats for later

btw the wolfram api integration is working great! the math stuff looks sooo cool
